## Strategy Overview

### Implemented Approach: Homology-Assisted Convolutional Network

**Concept**: Build a 2D CNN that combines sequence-derived features (from ESM-2) with distance/contact maps from homologous protein structures.

**Workflow**:
1. **Template Discovery**: Use HHblits to find homologous structures from PDB70/UniRef30 databases
2. **Sequence Alignment**: Map template coordinates to query residues using robust alignment
3. **Feature Integration**: Combine ESM-2 embeddings (64 channels) with template features (4 channels)
4. **Binary Prediction**: CNN outputs binary contact maps (0/1 values) using BCEWithLogitsLoss

**Input Format**: 68-channel tensor (4 template + 64 ESM2 channels) of shape `(68, L, L)`
**Output Format**: Binary L×L contact map with 8Å Cα-Cα distance threshold (6Å for Glycine)

### Alternative Strategies Comparison

| Strategy | Approach | Pros | Cons | Complexity |
|----------|----------|------|------|------------|
| **Homology-Assisted CNN** | 2D CNN + Templates | Easiest implementation<br>Proven accuracy<br>Combines ESM + structure | Template-dependent<br>L×L memory usage | **Low** ✅ |
| **Graph Neural Network** | Residue graph + structural edges | Natural geometry encoding<br>Scales with L | Complex implementation<br>Memory-intensive | **Medium** |
| **Template/Retrieval Transformer** | Transformer conditioned on homologs | Richest context<br>AlphaFold-level potential | Research-scale complexity<br>Long training time | **High** |

**Why This Strategy?** The Homology-Assisted CNN offers the best balance of implementation complexity, computational efficiency, and proven accuracy - making it ideal for practical applications and rapid development.

## 🔧 Building Your Dataset

**Did you know?** Our high-performance model was trained on 15,000 protein structures! This section shows you how to generate your own CNN dataset from PDB files.

### 📁 Setting Up Your Data Structure

Before generating your dataset, make sure your PDB files are properly organized:

```bash
# Create the standard directory structure
mkdir -p data/train data/test

# Extract your PDB files to these folders:
# - data/train/  -> Training PDB files
# - data/test/   -> Test PDB files for evaluation

# Example structure:
data/
├── train/
│   ├── 1ABC.pdb
│   ├── 2DEF.pdb
│   └── ... (your training proteins)
└── test/
    ├── 1GHI.pdb
    ├── 2JKL.pdb
    └── ... (your test proteins)
```

### 📊 Dataset Generation Process

The dataset generation pipeline transforms raw PDB files into ready-to-train HDF5 datasets with 68-channel tensors:

1. **PDB Processing**: Extract sequences and coordinates from protein structure files
2. **ESM2 Embeddings**: Generate 64-channel sequence embeddings using Meta AI's ESM-2 model
3. **Contact Maps**: Create ground truth binary contact maps (8Å Cα-Cα distance threshold)
4. **Template Features**: Generate 4 channels of homology-based template information
