# Strategies for Integrating ESM2 Embeddings with Homologous Structures

---

## **Strategy 1: Homology-Assisted Convolutional Network (CNN)**

### **Concept**
Build a 2D CNN that combines sequence-derived features (from **ESM-2**) with distance/contact maps from one or more homologous protein structures.

For each query protein:
1. Identify homologs with solved structures (via **HHblits**, **JackHMMER**, or **BLAST/HHPred**).
2. Align their sequences to the query.
3. Use the alignment to map template 3D coordinates onto the query residues.
4. Compute a **template distance/contact map** (e.g., binary contacts at 8 Å cutoff or continuous distances).

In parallel, extract **per-residue ESM-2 embeddings** (or attention maps) from the query sequence using the official ESM library.  
Stack these as **multi-channel input** to a CNN, e.g.:

- Template distance map  
- ESM attention or outer-product features  
- Optional secondary-structure predictions (from **DSSP** or **SPIDER3**)  

The CNN (e.g., a ResNet-style 2D network) predicts contact probabilities for each residue pair.

---

### **Workflow & Tools**
- **Homolog search:**  
  Use JackHMMER or HHblits against UniProt/PDB. Tools like **HMMER/HHsuite**, **Bio.AlignIO**, and **SIFTS** can map UniProt hits to PDB entries.
- **Alignment:**  
  Align the query to each template using **Clustal Omega** or **Bio.pairwise2**.
- **PDB parsing:**  
  Load template structures with **Biopython’s Bio.PDB** or **MDAnalysis**.  
  Compute Cα distances for aligned residue pairs to form an L×L distance matrix.
- **ESM-2 features:**  
  Extract per-residue embeddings or attention maps using **esm2_t33_650M_UR50D** from the [ESM repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm).  
  The `esm-extract` CLI can output “contacts” (logistic-attention predictor) and “per_tok” embeddings.
- **CNN model:**  
  In **PyTorch**, build a 2D network taking an input tensor `(channels, L, L)` with convolutional layers (ResNet blocks, etc.) and sigmoid outputs.  
  Train with **binary cross-entropy** loss on known contacts.

---

### **Pros**
- Proven method (e.g. [Periscope](https://mlcb.github.io)): integrates co-evolution and template structure.  
- Straightforward to implement in PyTorch.  
- Combines sequence context (ESM) with explicit geometry.

### **Cons**
- Requires high-quality homologs (falls back to ESM-only otherwise).  
- Full L×L inputs are memory-heavy for long proteins.  
- Needs large training data and time-consuming preprocessing.

## **Strategy 2: Graph Neural Network (GNN) with Structural Edges**

### **Concept**
Represent the query protein as a **graph of residues** enriched with **structural edges from homologs**.

- **Nodes:** Amino acids (sequence order)
- **Node features:** ESM-2 embeddings (1024-D vector per residue)
- **Edges:** Connect residues close in the template structure (within 8 Å)  
  Optionally, add sequential edges between i and i+1.

Then apply a **GNN** (e.g., GraphConv or Graph Transformer) to propagate information over this graph.  
For contact prediction:
- (a) Predict edges directly (edge classification), or  
- (b) Compute pairwise scores via bilinear layer over updated node features.

---

### **Workflow & Tools**
- **Homology alignment:**  
  Align query to template; build adjacency matrix based on cutoff distance.
- **Graph construction:**  
  Use **PyTorch Geometric (PyG)** or **DGL** to create a graph:  
  - Node features: ESM-2 embeddings  
  - Edge index: structure-based contacts + sequence edges  
  - Edge attributes: distance or orientation
- **GNN model:**  
  Use **GraphConv**, **GATConv**, or Graph Transformers.  
  Fuse global sequence embedding via attention or concatenation.  
  Output: L×L contact map or edge probabilities.
- **Node2Vec (optional):**  
  Precompute Node2Vec embeddings on structure graph for additional spatial context.

---

### **Pros**
- Naturally encodes 3D geometry.  
- Scales with L (sparse edges), not L².  
- Flexible across proteins of varying lengths/shapes.

### **Cons**
- More complex to implement.  
- Graph ops can be memory-intensive.  
- Requires tuning to design graph-to-matrix outputs.

---

## **Strategy 3: Template-Augmented Transformer / Retrieval Models**

### **Concept**
Use a **Transformer model** conditioned on homologous structural information — inspired by **retrieval-augmented language models** and **AlphaFold’s template module**.

Example implementations:
- **RAG-style:** Retrieve homologous sequences; let ESM-2 cross-attend to them.  
- **Template-style:** Encode aligned template coordinates into feature maps (distance matrices, orientation features) and feed into transformer layers.

---

### **Workflow & Tools**
- **Homolog retrieval:**  
  Use **BLAST** or **HMMER** (or dense retrieval in RAG-ESM).
- **Template embedding:**  
  Align templates (via **TM-align**) and generate distance/orientation features using AlphaFold2-style feature extractors.
- **Transformer model:**  
  Modify ESM-2 to accept extra inputs:
  - Cross-attention from query to homolog tokens  
  - Learned spatial bias (distance-based)  
  - Template embedding concatenation
- **Training:**  
  Fine-tune transformer end-to-end on contact prediction.  
  Use multitask objectives (masking + contact loss).

---

### **Pros**
- Rich context; learns geometric patterns from templates.  
- Retrieval-based conditioning without full MSAs.  
- Potentially AlphaFold-level performance.

### **Cons**
- Very complex implementation.  
- Requires major architectural modification.  
- Computationally heavy and data-hungry.

## **Pros & Cons Summary**

| Strategy | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Homology-CNN** | Easiest to implement, proven accuracy, combines ESM + structure | Relies on templates; large L×L inputs |
| **Graph Neural Net** | Encodes geometry naturally; scales with L | Complex; memory-intensive; custom output required |
| **Template/Retrieval Transformer** | Richest context; conceptually powerful | Research-scale complexity; long training time |

## **Recommendation and Implementation Plan**

Given a **one-week timeframe** and the goal of extending ESM2 for contact prediction,  
**Strategy 1 (Homology-Assisted CNN)** is the most practical.

### **Implementation Steps**

#### **1. Preprocessing**
- Run **HHblits/JackHMMER** to find templates (UniProt → PDB).  
- Align sequences and compute **template contact/distance matrices** using **Biopython**.  
- Extract **secondary structure (DSSP)** and **RSA** as optional 1D features.

#### **2. ESM-2 Embeddings**
- Use [facebookresearch/esm](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) to extract embeddings:  
  ```bash
  esm-extract esm2_t33_650M_UR50D sequences.fasta esm_embeddings/
